# GetSearchResultApi

Some of the features that appear on the main page have not been implemented:
* Login
* Caroussel for the previous search is not working properly
* Search by Price Range and by Rent, Buy, Sale
* A picture of the property, for the moment, it is just showing a static picture

What was implemented is a search by (Addres, City, State). You can then see important information about the property.
It is also possible to see the previous properties searched.

###Here is the instruction received from Zillow:

Create a simple web app that allows a user to enter an address for a home and then see details for that home from Zillow's GetSearchResults API (API key: X1-ZWz1dyb53fdhjf_6jziz). The output should be a cleanly-displayed representation of whatever came back in the API. We're not testing your design skills here and so we're not looking for beauty, but at the same time, try to make it something you'd be proud to show friends and family. If the API responds with an error for some reason, the user should be informed and not left hanging.
